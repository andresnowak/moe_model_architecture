# Dense to MoE model ablation experiments

The baseline MoE experiments with Qwen3-30B-A3B is kind of in a mess due to all kinds of problems in Megatron and the low training throughputs. Also, it is not so clear for me how should we utilize this baseline model. Hence, I want to slightly switch the gear with the following roadmap:

- For the original Qwen3-30B-A3B experiments:

  - Continue the experiment but with a focus more on the performance side. 

- For the exploration of MoE model:

  I want to follow the prior works to understand and verify the scaling law for MoE models. 

  - A dense model (Apertus -8B or Qwen3-8B). The dense model will be used to verify the MFU/loss.
  - A comparable MoE model using the scaling law from the prior work. The MoE model will be configured carefully, and to see if it can surpass the dense baseline. 

## Theoratical

1. Define MoE vs Dense in terms of FLOPs
2. MoE consumes less computation while maintains a larger model size
3. Given a 8B dense model size, when will a MoE model surpass it?
   - Fixed compute budget $C$: 

$\begin{align*}
& M = 6\Phi_{comp}\\
& C = M\cdot D
\end{align*}$

where $\Phi_{comp}$ is the parameter size that involved in computation, $M$ is the computational cost per token and $D$ is the number of tokens. 

- Fixed wall time $T$: 

  currently the moe training is slow。
